# Information on Satellite Data Used in this Project
Satellite products are available at different processing levels. This study primarily relied on L3 gridded data. However, we began to explore the use of L2 data as well, especially for atmospheric products and assessing surface loading-- working to try to detect ash deposition.</p>
More information on satellite processing levels can be found:
- [From NASA Ocean Color](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/resources/docs/product-levels/)
- [From NOAA](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/atmospheric-composition-training/satellite_data_processing_levels.php)

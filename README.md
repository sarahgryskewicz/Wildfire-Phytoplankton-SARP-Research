# Student-Airborne-Research-Program-SARP-
This is a collection of the notebooks I completed during my time in NASA's Student Airborne Research Program (SARP) on the East Coast as a member of the Oceans research group. 

My summer project investigated the impacts of the January 2025 California wildfires on phytoplankton blooms off the southern California coast in the Pacific Ocean. I was mentored by Sarah Lang, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Phode Island studying physical oceanography, and Dr. Tom Bell, an Associate Scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. I primarily used satellite data for this research, working mostly with the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership's (SNPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) as well as the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite that was launched in 2024. More information covering these satellites can be found below.

Being a Meteorology major, I had practically no experience in pure ocean-based research assessing biological impacts, so this summer really took me out of my comfort zone (in a good way of course) and exposed me to an area of research I'd never thought about investigating before. In addition to this, SARP further refined my skills working with satellite data from different satellite platforms and products. I am very excited to share the code I've been working on all summer in this repository in hope that others may find it useful as well. 

Having only ~3-4 weeks for data analysis on this topic, there is a lot of future work that I did not get to pursue. Future directions with this project involve..
- Using in-situ data: Compare in-situ data to satellite observations. Consider water temperatures.
- Lagrangian approach: Follow the trajectory of water sample and analyze how it biologically changes in time. 
- Spatial variability: Expand on sample wildfire events. What is the latitudinal impact of fires on phytoplankton along the West Coast?
- Particulate types and loading: Investigating the type, size, and loading of particulates in the area.
- Seasonality: How would a summertime wildfire impact phytoplankton and phytoplankton blooms in the same region of interest?
- Phytoplankton community group: If there was no bloom response, could there have been a shift in phytoplankton types within the area?
- Emission source type: Whatâ€™s the influence of forested emissions versus urban emissions on phytoplankton/phytoplankton blooms?
